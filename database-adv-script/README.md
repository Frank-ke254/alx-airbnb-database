# Using JOINS to write complex queries:

## JOIN:
A JOIN clause is used to combine rows from two or more tables, based on a related column between them.

## JOIN examples:
INNER JOIN: Returns records that have matching values in both tables
LEFT JOIN: Returns all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right table
RIGHT JOIN: Returns all records from the right table, and the matched records from the left table
CROSS JOIN: Returns all records from both tables
